# Route Organization Update

## Overview
The routes have been reorganized to provide clear separation between frontend and API backend functionality, along with groundwork for an admin panel.

## Route Structure

### Frontend Routes
- `/` - Main homepage with URL shortener interface

### Public API Routes (No Authentication Required)
- `/api/health_check` - Health check endpoint
- `/api/redirect/{id}` - Redirect to original URL

### Protected API Routes (Requires API Key)
- `/api/shorten` - Create shortened URLs (requires `x-api-key` header)

### Protected Admin Routes (Requires API Key)
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/profile` - User profile management
- `/admin/login` - Login page
- `/admin/register` - Registration page

### Static Assets
- `/static/*` - CSS, JavaScript, and other static files

## Authentication

### API Key Protection
Routes under `/api/shorten` and `/admin/*` are protected by API key middleware. Include the API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```
x-api-key: your-api-key-uuid
```

### User Authentication (Future Implementation)
The admin routes provide the groundwork for future user authentication implementation. Currently, they serve HTML pages but will need backend user management functionality.

## Key Changes

1. **Clear Separation**: Frontend served from `/` with API routes under `/api/`
2. **Maintained Protection**: `/shorten` route remains protected by API key
3. **Admin Foundation**: New `/admin/` routes for user profiles and management
4. **Consistent Structure**: All related routes grouped logically

## Templates Added
- `admin.html` - Admin dashboard
- `profile.html` - User profile management
- `login.html` - User login form
- `register.html` - User registration form

## CSS Enhancements
Added comprehensive styling for:
- Admin panel layout
- User profile interface
- Authentication forms
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Future Enhancements
1. User registration and authentication backend
2. Database schema for user management
3. Session management
4. User-specific URL tracking
5. Analytics and reporting features
